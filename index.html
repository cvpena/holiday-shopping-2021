<p> Christmas this year may still not look like the way it was before Covid-19 but it’s certainly predicted to be better, at least in terms of shopping, according to experts. </p>

<p> Since September, there have been <a href="https://www.today.com/shop/holiday-shopping-guide-2021-t232270">reports of worker shortages and transportation delays</a>, which worried both retailers and customers, who are anticipating the holiday shopping season. People have been encouraged to buy earlier and avoid waiting at the last minute. </p>

<p> The National Retail Federation forecasts that holiday retail sales will increase between 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent from 2020, totaling between $843.4 billion and $859 billion, <a href="https://nrf.com/research/monthly-economic-review-november-2021"> according to its Monthly Economic Review for November</a>. </p>

<p> Online sales are also expected to be up between 11 percent and 15 percent, totaling to between $218.3 billion and $226.2 billion. </p>

<p> This means that despite the retail and economic challenges caused by the pandemic, people are still willing to spend money… and definitely spend more than they did last year. </p>

<p> There were challenges to economic forecasting in the last two years due to the pandemic, according to Jack Kleinhenz, Chief Economist of the NRF who created the monthly report. Disposable income, past retail sales, consumer spending and employment are some of the factors taken into consideration.

<p> Suffice to say, if the NRF’s prediction comes true when December hits, it goes to show that Americans were aiming to make the holidays this year better than last year and understandably so. </p>
